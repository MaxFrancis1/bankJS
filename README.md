# BankJS

This is my banking app I am making using JavaScript.

In this project I made a banking application that people can use how they want to. To start I made a plan on how to proceed, this included a lot of writing on a notepad.
On the notepad I planned out how it would all work and what it would do. Also I made user stories that followed with what I wanted the app to be.


#### To run this
Firstly you should clone the repository.
Then simply run the 'index.html' file in chrome.


### User stories

#### 1
As a bank user
So that I can see my bank account and name I would like them to be displayed
So I can make sure that I am using the correct account.

#### 2
As a bank user
I would like to note down what deposits I have done
So that I can remember

#### 3
As a bank user
I would like to be able to print my statement
So I can review my deposits and withdraws.
